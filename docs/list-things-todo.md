## 🔌 TODO-notes (no particular order)

- Maybe add a features section?
- make every define and creation with general command that has `$variables` based on the system and user choice
- Fork iommu, UEFI, laptop detection, GPU detection and some other features from https://github.com/T-vK/GPU-pass-through-compatibility-check
- Actual CPU Core allocation instead of vCPUs
- USB _Passthrough guide (maybe also mouse and keyboard passthrough with endev?)
- convert the xmls into actual defining commands of qemu
- you'll also likely need `vendor-reset` for cards suffering from the AMD reset bug (RX 5000 and older).
- (maybe?) IOMMU and VFIO
- gotchas section from archwiki pci passthrough
- GPU Passthrough edits in XML for `kvm hidden state` and `vendor_id` 
- make use of `hostnamectl` somehow
- ~~Stealth VM notes~~
- ~~GPU Passthrough options and notes~~
- ~~AMD GPUs can use `vendor_id="AuthenticAMD"`~~
- Single GPU Passthrough for NVIDIA and AMD


## 🔮 Feature ideas

- ask user to enter the path to the isos instead of putting it in one folder (just for giving an option to the user)
- ꧁ Better design ꧂
- ability to make multiple VMs from the same profile.
- Motherboard Compatibility list (based on good IOMMU Groups separation)
